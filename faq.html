                    The disc that appears on the game screen is called a striking circle. When the circle on the outside of the strike circle shrinks and falls just on the strike circle, tap the strike circle.
                    Some circles come with a slider that you hold down and follow as it moves.
                    When a large disc appears on the screen, press and hold the button to quickly rotate around the center of the circle. By default, the buttons are the left and right mouse buttons and the Z and X buttons, which can be modified in the settings.

                    <h2>Cursor movement seems to be a bit delayed？</h2>
                    Try enabling the hardware cursor in the settings, this will reduce the latency of the cursor feedback. However, in some operating systems or browsers, there may be problems such as flickering or not displaying the cursor, so it is turned off by default. In addition, at present, the cursor size of the hardware cursor is only fixed in 3 stops, which is displayed as the smallest below 0.65 and the largest above 0.95.

        			<h2>The game is very stuck, what to do？</h2>
        			You can uncheck "Use system resolution" in the settings and set the resolution to a lower value than the system scale (the computer system scale for laptops or high-resolution screens is usually more than 100%). It is recommended to avoid excessive CPU usage, close an antivirus software like 360/PC Manager, and try closing other tabs in the browser and restarting the browser. Make sure you are using a mainstream modern browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome). If it's still a card, please<a href="https://github.com/111116/osu">提issue</a>。
